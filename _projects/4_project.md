This is the project for Global Challenge Lab 22 (Climate Action) hosted by Imperial Enterprise Lab.

I formed an International team with students from China, Canada, and Ghana, and gave our innovative solution for
the “Agriculture and Land Sustainability” track. We proposed to transform abandoned houses in North America
into shared greenhouses for individual farming, designed a platform for this idea, and submitted our video pitch.

Here's our key idea: 
> Our proposal addresses the issues of land conservation and food security, centering on using agriculture for urban regeneration.
> The pandemic has caused many buildings to become vacant. These empty sites can be repurposed into energy-efficient smart greenhouses, where growers can implement a new, diverse urban demographic by reusing available sources. 
> Our project leverages our team’s expertise in AI, biology, and business, and is distinguished by our vision of making agriculture accessible to everyone. 
> We will deploy AI in crop cultures, analytics, and blockchain in supply chain management. Growers can connect on an app that provides growth and market data. We are the conduit between B2B and B2C, enabling integration of producers and consumers, positively impacting land reservation, food improvement, and enhanced participation in climate actions aligned with SDG13. 
> We want to create a world where everyone feed themselves through small-scale family farming, not industrial farming - imagine that!
