I am Jinhan Li(李谨菡), a senior-year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Technology at [IIIS](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) (a.k.a. [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/), directed by [Andrew Chi-Chih Yao](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/yao/)). I was fortunate to work as a student intern in Professor [Yuke Zhu](https://yukezhu.me/)'s group at [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/). Previously, I was fortunate to work in Professor [Yi Wu](https://jxwuyi.weebly.com/)'s group at [IIIS](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).

My research interests center on machine learning and robotics. I'm enthusiastic about using AI to create intelligent robots that can be reliable companions for human, in the hope that my work can contribute to making a better society.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
