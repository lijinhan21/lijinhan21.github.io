I participated in the "Global Challenge Exchange" summer camp hosted by Tsinghua University in Seattle, USA for 10 days. We formed a group of four and designed a safety stick for the elders that can automatically detect accidental fall and made a prototype. I self-learned basic machine learning (I was in high school by that time), and wrote the corresponding codes, and got “Outstanding Participant”.
