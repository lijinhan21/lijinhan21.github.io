I worked on a project about quadrupedal robots together with a Ph.D. student, advised by Prof. [Yi Wu](https://jxwuyi.weebly.com/). We trained the quadrupedal robot to stand up and perform agile bipedal “dancing” motions such as ballet via Reinforcement Learning. The robot can track the human motions from a video, or follow commands given by LLM based on natural language instructions.

Second-author paper *Learning Agile Bipedal Motions on a Quadrupedal Robot* was just submitted to ICRA 2024.
