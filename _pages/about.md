Hi! I am Jinhan Li(李谨菡), a third-year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Technology at [IIIS](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) (a.k.a. [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/), directed by [Andrew Chi-Chih Yao](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/yao/)).

Currently, my research interests center on reinforcement learning, robotics, and the use of AI for social good. I'm intrigued by the rapid expansion of AI, but I also care deeply about where the path leads us and how these technologies affect society. I'm enthusiastic about using AI to solve actual real-world problems, such as creating robots that can be reliable companions for human, in the hope that my work can contribute to making a better society.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
