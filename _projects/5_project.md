We formed a team with peers from China, USA, and Japan, I'm the co-founder and China-lead. We designed and gathered more than 400 questionnaires about the views of Coronavirus policy from people across the globe. We interviewed people from different classes to
explore the social effects of COVID-19. Part of our results and insights were posted on [our website](https://coronaview.github.io/interview/int1/), the remaining part will be posted soon.
