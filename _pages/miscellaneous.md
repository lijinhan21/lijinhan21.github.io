#### Music

I'm a music lover, and I like to "play" with music in different forms (though I'm not an expert in any of those fields). Music makes me feel "alive".

- Singing. I can sing for 2 hours alone in a KTV. I'm always looking for like-minded people who would like to sing with me. [This](https://node.kg.qq.com/personal?uid=639c998d232e3e8831) is my personal page in "全民k歌" app with some recordings I made when I was in high school.
- Musicals. Some of my favorite musicals are Hamilton, Come from away, and Six. One of my dream is to live near Broadway for one month and watch musicals every day.
- Listening to classical music. Classical music really help me calm down, whether I'm too happy or too depressed. When I'm coding at night, a quiet Piano Concerto is my efficiency booster. When I'm extremely sad or angry, MAHLER Symphone No.9 could help me release my extreme and negative feelings.
- Playing musical instruments. I learned to play the piano, the drums, and the saxophone when I was little and achieved level ten in saxophone playing when I was in primary school. A few years ago, I tried to self-learn guitar. Sometimes I feel like I could make a amusing band myself.

#### Running

I love running. I love the feeling when winds gently brush my face, and scenery changes like a Kaleidoscope when I move forward. I like to use running as a platform to meet new friends!

#### Cats

I have two cats at home, and they are all extremely cute! 

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/cat1.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/cat3.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

I can't stand those people who abandon or abuse cats. I hope to pour my strength into rescuing more stray animals and help them find lovely home.
